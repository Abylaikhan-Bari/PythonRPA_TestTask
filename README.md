# File Categorization Tool

## Description

This tool categorizes files in a directory based on their type (extension). You can filter files by size, modification date, and extension.

## Files

- `main.py`: Main script for file categorization.
- `unittest_file_categorization.py`: Unit tests for verifying the functionality.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Program**:
    
    python main.py
    
    - Enter the directory path.
    - Optionally, provide filters for file size, modification date, and extension.

2. **Run Tests**:
    
    python unittest_file_categorization.py
    
    - This runs tests to ensure the program works correctly.

## Logging

Logs are saved in `file_categorization.log` for tracking the process and errors.
